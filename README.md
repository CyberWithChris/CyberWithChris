I am a Master of Cyber Security student with a deep passion for technology and cyber security with a dedication to solving complex problems.

## Objective
My journey in SaaS Sales sparked a desire to develop technical skills, which  led me to cybersecurity. I am now motivated to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
